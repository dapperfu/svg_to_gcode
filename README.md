# svg_to_gcode

Module is from https://github.com/JTechPhotonics/J-Tech-Photonics-Laser-Tool

The module is only in the release folder and I can't find the exact implementation.

Created a repository so that it can be added as a submodule and you can then ```git clone ~/.config/inkscape/extensions/```
